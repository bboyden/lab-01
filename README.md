# lab-01
In this lab I basically setup my whole enitre computer for this course. I installed mostly all the tools, practiced using the terminal, some shortcuts, and even made my very first Node.js server file. It was kinda confusing at first, but I figured it out. The point I think was just to get everything ready so I could do real work later.
